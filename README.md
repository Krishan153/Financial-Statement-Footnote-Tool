# Financial-Statement-Footnote-Tool
This is a very helpful tool when rolling forward FS footnotes.

To use the tool start with creating a template.docx file and an financialinfo.xlxs file
with the current and last year's data. In your template.docx make sure you are putting 
{{ text left of data in financialinfo.xlxs }} wherever you want the script to update. 
Once setup is complete and python will automatically create a new document with the updated
financial statement infor using the provided excel document.
